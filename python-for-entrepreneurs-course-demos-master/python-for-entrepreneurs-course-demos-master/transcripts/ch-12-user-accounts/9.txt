00:03 So a question you have to answer for yourself is do you want 
00:05 the do it yourself version or do you want the API version? 
00:09 So, you've seen what's involved to some degree, we're not finished yet, 
00:12 with creating and managing accounts in your application, 
00:15 we've done all the best practices around creating 
00:17 and managing accounts and passwords, 
00:19 but we still have things like what if the user forgets the account, 
00:22 how do we send them a password reset, things like that. 
00:25 And, it might be worth considering working with something like Stormpath, 
00:29 so Stormpath is basically authentication and identity as a service, 
00:35 so instead of storing your users directly, 
00:37 you integrate with their API, they store that information, 
00:40 they set up all sorts of things, in fact, let me just show you a video they put together 
00:45 and you can decide whether or not you want to use what I have shown you, 
00:48 or what they are up to. 
00:53 For decades, software developers custom-built every part of an application in house. 
00:56 But today, great software teams don't build anything they don't have to, 
01:00 building user management your application is extraordinarily time consuming, 
01:03 and to do it right is even more difficult, because you have to be a security expert. 
01:06 Stormpath is a user management API built for developers 
01:10 so they can plug it into their applications, to offload user management 
01:14 so they can get back to building the core of their applications. 
01:16 Thousands of companies across industries use Stormpath, 
01:19 from early stage startups to the federal government. 
01:22 And all of them are using it for the same reason, 
01:25 to get their applications out to market faster and reduce the risk of getting it wrong.
01:28 Stormpath supports many different forms of authentication, 
01:30 from API keys to usernames and passwords, to OAuth tokens, 
01:34 we also make it easy for the end users to login to your application using credentials 
01:38 they might already have in other systems, 
01:40 whether be Facebook or Google or enterprise single sign on systems. 
01:43 Stormpath is also the most powerful authorization API available, 
01:46 we support simple role based access control mechanisms using just user groups, 
01:50 all the way to very complicated per user permissioning schemes. 
01:55 Also Stormpath is the only API that will give you a native multi-tendency data model 
01:59 so if you need to support multiple organizations in your application, 
02:02 Stormpath has you covered out of the box. 
02:04 If you Stormpath, you'll never store credentials again, 
02:07 you can give us as little or as much of the user did as you want, 
02:10 and we take care of all the security. 
02:12 Stormpath uses security best practices that have been peer reviewed 
02:15 and vetted to provide the best in class security possible. 
02:19 We provide developers everything they need, to get up and running in a few minutes, 
02:22 we've got comprehensive STKS, we've got extensive documentation, 
02:26 we've got fantastic live support to help you throughout implementation.
02:30 We really pride ourselves on having really good developer support, 
02:33 if you want a question answered about Stormpath 
02:36 you re going to be talking to someone technical, who can help you out with your use case.
02:40 Today's applications need to scale from ten users to ten million. 
02:43 If you get a burst of traffic, our infrastructure will automatically scale
02:46 to handle that additional load. And then when your load goes back to normal, 
02:50 our infrastructure will scale down for you automatically as well. 
02:52 You can implement Stormpath in three lines of code 
02:55 and be off and running with production-grade user management. 
02:57 You can own the burden of building identity infrastructure 
03:01 or you can rely on Stormpath, with trusted experts in user management.

03:09 So that looks pretty cool and you know, 
03:13 if I had known about Stormpath when I started creating my site, 
03:16 maybe I would have used them, I ma not entirely sure, 
03:18 I am really happy the way things are working for me,
03:21 but one of the goals of this class and one of your goals should be 
03:24 to get up and running as fast as possible, if Stormpath helps you do that, 
03:28 then feel free to sign up for their free tier and go, they've got self-registration, 
03:32 they manage the login screens, the password resets, 
03:35 the verification and "welcome" emails,
03:38 all sorts of stuff that you would have to write yourself.
